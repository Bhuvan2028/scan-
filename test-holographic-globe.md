# Holographic Globe Component Overview

I've successfully created a stunning holographic globe component for the hero section of your landing page. Here's what I implemented:

## Key Features

**Enhanced Visual Design:**
- **Holographic Effect:** Blue and purple neon colors with transparent wireframe globe
- **Grid Projection:** Floating holographic grid surrounding the globe
- **Connection Arcs:** Animated arcs connecting various points on the globe
- **Dual Scanning Rings:** Two rotating rings for scanning effect
- **Atmosphere Glow:** Dynamic distort material for atmospheric effect
- **Particle Grid:** Floating points creating a 3D grid around the globe

**Animation Effects:**
- Smooth auto-rotation
- Dynamic floating motion
- Scanning rings with dual colors
- Animated connection arcs
- Grid point fluctuations
- Atmospheric distortion

**Visual Overlays:**
- Radial gradient background
- Diagonal grid lines for holographic feel
- Scan line animation moving vertically
- Holographic frame borders
- Glowing corner effects

## Component Files Modified

1. **`new design of scanner/securescan/src/components/marketing/holographic-globe.tsx`** - Created new holographic globe component
2. **`new design of scanner/securescan/src/components/marketing/split-hero.tsx`** - Updated to use the new holographic globe

## Usage

The holographic globe is now the centerpiece of the hero section, replacing the previous DomainDNAHero component. It features:

- **Responsive Design:** Works on mobile and desktop
- **Interactive:** Mouse movement creates parallax effects
- **Performance:** Optimized 3D rendering with React Three Fiber and Drei
- **Customizable:** Props to control animation speed and active state

## Technology Stack

- **React Three Fiber:** 3D rendering library
- **React Three Drei:** Helper components for 3D scenes
- **Three.js:** 3D graphics engine
- **Framer Motion:** Animation library
- **Tailwind CSS:** Styling

The holographic globe adds a futuristic, high-tech feel to your landing page, perfectly aligning with the security and scanning theme.
